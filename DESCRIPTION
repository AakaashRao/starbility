Description: starbility is used to produce a plot showing the stability of the OLS estimate of an explanatory variable on an outcome variable under combinations of a given set of controls. Plots contain two panels: the top panel shows coefficient point estimates and confidence intervals for each specification, and the bottom panel is a graphical display of the control variables included in the specification.
